/**
 * ⚠️ DEPRECATED: This file is being phased out.

 * Backend DTO types have been moved directly into their respective mapper files
 * to create a hard compile-time boundary. Backend types CANNOT be imported from
 * this file or any other location outside the mapper that defines them.
 * 
 * This enforces the principle: Backend DTOs are implementation details of mappers,
 * not public contracts.

// This file intentionally left empty to prevent accidental imports
// Each mapper file now contains its own Backend DTO definitions
