"""
Admin module for centralized RBAC (SKELETON ONLY - Phase 3).

This module provides declarative definitions for future RBAC implementation:
- Centralized RBAC permissions (enums, role mappings)
- Placeholder for permission-based dependencies
- Placeholder for async audit logging
- Empty admin router (no endpoints)

NOTE: Phase 3 contains only skeleton/declarations. No active enforcement.
Future phases will add runtime enforcement and active endpoints.
