"""
Admin Dependencies - Permission-based dependency injection (SKELETON ONLY).

This module is a placeholder for future RBAC enforcement logic.
Currently contains no active enforcement - this is by design for Phase 3.

Future phases will implement:
- require_permissions(*permissions): Enforce permission checks
- get_admin_user(): Get authenticated admin user

NOTE: No runtime enforcement in this phase. Declarative skeleton only.

# TODO: Future implementation will add:
# - require_permissions(*permissions) dependency factory
# - get_admin_user() convenience dependency
# - Integration with PermissionService for runtime checks
#
# Phase 3 (current): Skeleton only - no active enforcement
# Phase 4 (future): Active RBAC enforcement
