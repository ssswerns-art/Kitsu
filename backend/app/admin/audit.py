"""
Async Audit Logger for Admin Actions (SKELETON ONLY).

This module is a placeholder for future audit logging functionality.
Currently contains no implementation - this is by design for Phase 3.

Future phases will implement async, non-blocking audit logging for:
- Admin actions
- Parser job execution
- Critical system changes

NOTE: No active audit logic in this phase. Skeleton only.
"""
from __future__ import annotations

# TODO: Future implementation will add:
# - AdminAuditLogger class with async logging methods
# - log_admin_action() - Log admin operations
# - log_parser_job() - Log parser job execution
# - log_critical_change() - Log critical system changes
# - Async execution via run_in_executor()
# - Structured JSON output
#
# Phase 3 (current): Empty skeleton - no audit logic
# Phase 4 (future): Active async audit logging
